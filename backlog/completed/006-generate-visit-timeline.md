## Description

Aggregate all data sources (photos, saved places, reviews) to build a comprehensive chronological visit history for each region. Calculate visit frequency, identify patterns, and determine first/last visit dates.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Data Aggregation**
   - [x] Combine photo timestamps from photo correlation data
   - [x] Include saved place timestamps where available
   - [x] Add review dates as confirmed visits
   - [x] Deduplicate visits on same day to same region

2. **Timeline Generation**
   - [x] Create chronological visit list per region
   - [x] Group visits by year and month for pattern analysis
   - [x] Calculate gaps between visits
   - [x] Identify visit clusters (multiple visits in short period)

3. **Visit Analysis**
   - [x] Calculate total visits per region
   - [x] Determine first and last visit dates
   - [x] Calculate average time between visits
   - [x] Identify most frequently visited regions
   - [x] Track visit trends over time (increasing/decreasing)

4. **Output**
   - [x] Generate `data/visit_timeline.json` with complete timeline
   - [x] Include visit source (photo/review/saved) for each entry
   - [x] Create monthly and yearly summaries
   - [x] Generate visit frequency rankings

## Technical Requirements

- Efficient date/time operations with python-dateutil
- Handle timezone considerations
- Implement configurable visit deduplication window
- Generate both detailed and summary views

## Completion Summary

Task completed successfully on 2025-01-19. All acceptance criteria were fulfilled:

**Results Achieved:**
- Successfully aggregated data from all sources: 30 photo visits, 29 review visits, 1,230 saved place visits
- Combined 1,289 total visits before deduplication from all data sources
- Implemented intelligent deduplication with 24-hour window, removing 26.5% duplicates
- Generated comprehensive timeline for 281 regions with 948 total visits
- Created chronological visit lists per region with proper sorting
- Grouped visits by year and month for pattern analysis
- Calculated visit gaps and frequency metrics
- Determined first/last visit dates and average time between visits
- Generated `/Users/lance/git/oh_my_stars/data/visit_timeline.json` with complete timeline data
- Included visit source (photo/review/saved_place) for each entry
- Created monthly and yearly summaries for trend analysis
- Generated visit frequency rankings with top 10 regions
- Date range spans actual visit dates (approximately 10 years, filtering out 1970 epoch time)
- Top region: Oklahoma City (196 visits, avg 26.5 days between visits)
- Comprehensive regional analysis across actual visit timeline (filtering out epoch time artifacts)
- Proper timezone handling and efficient date operations
- Smart deduplication preserved highest-priority source data

The implementation successfully created a comprehensive visit timeline that aggregates all location data sources, providing valuable insights into travel patterns, visit frequency, and regional preferences. The logic has been updated to filter out epoch time (1970-01-01) timestamps, focusing on the actual ~10 years of visit data.
