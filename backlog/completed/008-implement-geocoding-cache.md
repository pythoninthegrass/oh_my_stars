title: Implement Geocoding Cache System
status: Completed
completed_date: 2025-08-19
priority: high
labels: [infrastructure, performance, geocoding]

## Description

Implement a persistent caching system for geocoding results to minimize API calls to Nominatim and improve performance. The cache should store both forward and reverse geocoding results with appropriate expiration handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Cache Implementation**
   - [x] Create file-based cache in `data/geocoding_cache.json`
   - [x] Implement cache key generation from coordinates/addresses
   - [x] Store full geocoding response for future use
   - [x] Include timestamp for cache entries

2. **Cache Operations**
   - [x] Check cache before making API calls
   - [x] Update cache after successful API responses
   - [x] Handle cache misses gracefully
   - [x] Implement cache statistics tracking

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - [x] Enforce 1 request per second for Nominatim
   - [x] Queue geocoding requests appropriately
   - [x] Log rate limit compliance
   - [x] Handle rate limit errors

4. **Cache Management**
   - [x] Implement cache expiration (configurable, default 30 days)
   - [x] Provide cache clear functionality
   - [x] Track cache hit/miss ratio
   - [x] Implement cache size limits

## Technical Requirements

- Thread-safe cache operations
- Proper User-Agent header: "oh_my_stars/1.0"
- JSON-based storage for portability
- Minimal memory footprint

## Example Cache Structure

```json
// data/geocoding_cache.json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "created": "2025-01-19T10:00:00Z",
    "last_updated": "2025-01-19T10:00:00Z",
    "total_entries": 150,
    "cache_hits": 1250,
    "cache_misses": 150
  },
  "entries": {
    "reverse_37.7749_-122.4194": {
      "timestamp": "2025-01-19T10:00:00Z",
      "query_type": "reverse",
      "query": {
        "latitude": 37.7749,
        "longitude": -122.4194
      },
      "response": {
        "city": "San Francisco",
        "state": "California",
        "country": "United States",
        "full_address": "San Francisco, CA, USA"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Completion Summary

Task completed successfully on 2025-08-19. All acceptance criteria were fulfilled:

**Results Achieved:**
- **Enhanced Cache Structure**: Completely redesigned the simple cache into comprehensive system with metadata, timestamps, and proper JSON structure
- **File-based Storage**: Implemented `data/geocoding_cache.json` with structured metadata including version, creation date, and statistics
- **Advanced Key Generation**: Created cache keys for both reverse and forward geocoding with proper normalization
- **Full Response Storage**: Cache stores complete geocoding responses including city, state, country details
- **Timestamp Management**: Every cache entry includes ISO 8601 timestamps for expiration tracking
- **Cache Operations**: Implemented get/set operations with automatic hit/miss tracking and graceful fallback
- **Rate Limiting**: Added `enforce_rate_limit()` method with 1-second minimum interval between API calls
- **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time cache hit/miss ratio calculation with session and persistent counters
- **Expiration Handling**: Configurable 30-day default expiration with automatic cleanup of expired entries
- **Cache Management**: Added `cache-stats` and `cache-clear` commands for monitoring and maintenance
- **Migration Support**: Seamless migration from old simple cache format to new structured format
- **API Integration**: Updated both LabeledPlacesExtractor and SavedPlacesExtractor to use enhanced caching
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling for cache operations and API timeouts
- **Performance Optimization**: Significant reduction in API calls through intelligent caching

**Technical Implementation:**
- Thread-safe operations with file-based persistence
- Proper User-Agent header: "oh-my-stars/1.0" for API compliance
- JSON-based storage for cross-platform compatibility
- Minimal memory footprint with lazy loading
- Comprehensive logging for cache operations and rate limiting

The enhanced geocoding cache system provides robust infrastructure for all location-based operations while respecting API rate limits and ensuring data persistence across sessions.
