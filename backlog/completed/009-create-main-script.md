status: Completed
completed_date: 2025-08-19
priority: medium
labels: [implementation, integration]

## Description

Create the main Python script that orchestrates all data extraction, processing, and report generation tasks. Implement using PEP 723 format for inline dependency management with uv.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Script Structure**
   - [x] Implement PEP 723 inline script metadata
   - [x] Define all required dependencies (geopy, python-dateutil)
   - [x] Create modular function structure for each processing step
   - [x] Implement proper command-line interface

2. **Data Pipeline**
   - [x] Orchestrate all extraction tasks in correct order
   - [x] Handle dependencies between tasks
   - [x] Implement progress reporting
   - [x] Support partial runs and resume capability

3. **Error Handling**
   - [x] Comprehensive try-except blocks for each operation
   - [x] Graceful handling of missing files
   - [x] Detailed error logging with context
   - [x] Non-destructive operations (read-only on source)

4. **Configuration**
   - [x] Configurable paths for input/output directories
   - [x] Adjustable distance thresholds
   - [x] Optional verbose/debug output
   - [x] Dry-run mode for testing

## Technical Requirements

- PEP 723 format with uv compatibility
- Async support for parallel operations where beneficial
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
- Cross-platform path handling

## Example Script Structure

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "geopy>=2.4.0",
#     "python-dateutil>=2.8.2",
# ]
# ///

"""
Google Takeout Maps Data Analyzer

Analyzes starred locations and photo geolocations from Google Takeout
to generate regional visit summaries and timelines.
"""

import json
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

from geopy.distance import distance
from dateutil import parser as date_parser

# Configuration
TAKEOUT_DIR = Path("takeout/maps")
OUTPUT_DIR = Path("data")
RADIUS_MILES = 10
CACHE_FILE = OUTPUT_DIR / "geocoding_cache.json"

def main():
    """Main entry point for the analysis pipeline."""
    setup_logging()
    ensure_directories()
    
    # Execute pipeline steps
    cache = load_or_create_cache()
    labeled_places = extract_labeled_places()
    regional_centers = calculate_regional_centers(labeled_places)
    # ... continue with other steps
    
    generate_summary_report(all_data)
    print("Analysis complete! See data/summary_report.md")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Dependencies

- All data extraction tasks (001-005)
- Geocoding cache implementation (008)

## Estimated Effort

4 hours

## Completion Summary

Task completed successfully on 2025-08-19. All acceptance criteria were fulfilled:

**Results Achieved:**
- **Enhanced PEP 723 Implementation**: Maintained proper inline script metadata with Python 3.13+ requirement and all dependencies (geopy, httpx, python-dateutil)
- **Comprehensive CLI Interface**: Added argparse-based command parsing with verbose help, options, and backwards compatibility
- **Complete Pipeline Orchestrator**: Created `DataAnalysisPipeline` class that manages all 7 processing steps with proper dependency tracking
- **Intelligent Dependency Management**: Implemented dependency checking and execution ordering ensuring tasks run in correct sequence
- **Progress Reporting**: Added detailed logging with step numbers, progress indicators (✓/✗), and completion emojis
- **Resume Capability**: Smart resume functionality detects completed steps and skips them, allowing efficient pipeline restarts
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks around each step with detailed error logging and graceful failure handling
- **Configuration Options**: Configurable input/output directories, verbose logging, and dry-run mode for testing
- **Prerequisites Validation**: Checks for required input files before starting pipeline execution
- **Non-destructive Operations**: All source data remains read-only, outputs go to separate data directory

**New Commands Added:**
- `run-pipeline`: Execute complete end-to-end analysis from Google Takeout data to final report
- `--dry-run`: Preview mode showing what would be executed without making changes
- `--verbose`: Enhanced logging output for debugging and detailed operation tracking
- `--input-dir/--output-dir`: Configurable directory paths for different data locations
- `--resume`: Resume pipeline from last completed step for efficient re-runs

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Modular step-based system with dependency graph resolution
- **Memory Efficiency**: Sequential execution prevents memory bloat with large datasets
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Proper Path handling and OS-agnostic file operations
- **Async-ready Structure**: Foundation laid for future parallel processing enhancements
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing individual commands continue to work unchanged

The enhanced main script provides a professional, production-ready interface for processing Google Takeout Maps data with intelligent orchestration, robust error handling, and user-friendly progress reporting.
