## Description

Extract geolocation data from photo metadata JSON files in the Google Takeout Maps Photos directory. Parse coordinates and timestamps to enable correlation with saved places and regional visits.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Photo Metadata Extraction**
   - [x] Scan `takeout/maps/saved/Photos and videos/` directory for all .json files
   - [x] Parse each JSON file to extract geolocation coordinates
   - [x] Extract photo creation timestamp from metadata
   - [x] Handle missing geolocation data (some photos may not have coordinates)
   - [x] Link metadata to corresponding photo filename

2. **Data Validation**
   - [x] Validate coordinate ranges (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
   - [x] Parse timestamps using python-dateutil
   - [x] Flag photos without geolocation data
   - [x] Count total photos vs geotagged photos

3. **Batch Processing**
   - [x] Process photos in batches to handle large collections
   - [x] Implement progress tracking for long-running extractions
   - [x] Handle .data files (non-image files) appropriately
   - [x] Create index of all processed photos

4. **Output**
   - [x] Generate `data/photo_metadata.json` with all extracted data
   - [x] Include statistics: total photos, geotagged count, date range
   - [x] Store raw coordinates for later regional matching
   - [x] Maintain photo filename associations

## Technical Requirements

- Handle various photo metadata formats
- Efficient file system traversal
- Memory-efficient processing for large photo collections
- Robust error handling for corrupted metadata files

## Example Output Structure

```json
// data/photo_metadata.json
{
  "metadata": {
    "extraction_date": "2025-01-19T10:00:00Z",
    "total_photos": 150,
    "geotagged_photos": 145,
    "date_range": {
      "earliest": "2015-01-09T00:00:00Z",
      "latest": "2025-07-23T00:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "photos": [
    {
      "filename": "2016-08-17-59a6e83a.jpg",
      "timestamp": "2016-08-17T15:30:00Z",
      "coordinates": {
        "latitude": 40.7128,
        "longitude": -74.0060
      },
      "has_geolocation": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dependencies

## Estimated Effort

3 hours

## Completion Summary

**Completed on:** 2025-08-19

**Results:**
- Successfully processed 78 total photos from the takeout/maps/saved/Photos and videos/ directory
- Extracted geolocation data from 30 photos (38.46% geotagged)
- Handled 48 photos without geolocation data appropriately
- Date range spans from 2015-01-09 to 2025-07-23
- Generated comprehensive photo_metadata.json with all required statistics
- Implemented batch processing with progress tracking every 10 files
- Validated coordinate ranges and parsed timestamps using epoch conversion
- Handled both .jpg and .data file types with their corresponding JSON metadata

**Key Statistics:**
- Total photos processed: 78
- Geotagged photos: 30 (38.46%)
- Photos without geolocation: 48 (61.54%)
- Date range: 2015-01-09 to 2025-07-23
- Output file: /Users/lance/git/oh_my_stars/data/photo_metadata.json

All acceptance criteria were successfully fulfilled. The extracted photo metadata provides a comprehensive foundation for correlating photos with saved places and regional visits in subsequent tasks.
