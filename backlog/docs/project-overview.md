# Google Takeout Maps Analysis - Project Overview

## Project Goal

Analyze Google Takeout Maps data to identify starred locations and correlate photo locations with visits to cities/regions. Generate comprehensive reports showing travel patterns, visit frequencies, and regional summaries.

## Backlog Items Summary

### High Priority Tasks

1. **001 - Extract and Group Starred/Labeled Places by Region** (4 hours)
   - Parse labeled places JSON
   - Group by city/region
   - Calculate regional centers
   - Foundation for all location-based analysis

2. **002 - Extract Saved Places with Timestamps** (3 hours)
   - Parse saved places with timestamps
   - Integrate with regional grouping
   - Track save dates for timeline analysis

3. **003 - Extract Photo Geolocation Data** (3 hours)
   - Extract coordinates from photo metadata
   - Parse timestamps from photos
   - Handle large photo collections efficiently

4. **008 - Implement Geocoding Cache System** (2 hours)
   - Critical infrastructure component
   - Prevents redundant API calls
   - Ensures Nominatim rate limit compliance

### Medium Priority Tasks

5. **004 - Correlate Photos to Regions and Saved Places** (4 hours)
   - Match photos to regions using 10-mile radius
   - Find photos near saved places
   - Group photos by region

6. **005 - Extract Review Timestamps as Visit Confirmations** (3 hours)
   - Use reviews as confirmed visit dates
   - Match reviews to places and regions
   - Add to visit timeline

7. **006 - Generate Comprehensive Visit Timeline** (4 hours)
   - Aggregate all data sources
   - Build chronological visit history
   - Calculate visit patterns and frequency

8. **009 - Create Main Python Script with PEP 723 Format** (4 hours)
   - Orchestrate entire pipeline
   - Implement with uv compatibility
   - Handle all data processing steps

### Low Priority Tasks

9. **007 - Generate Human-Readable Summary Report** (3 hours)
   - Create markdown report
   - Include visual elements
   - Present insights and patterns

10. **010 - Implement Data Validation and Testing** (3 hours)
    - Validate all data inputs/outputs
    - Create test cases
    - Ensure data integrity

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies
- **geopy**: Distance calculations and geocoding
- **python-dateutil**: Flexible timestamp parsing
- **uv**: Package management (PEP 723)

### Data Flow
1. Extract data from three sources (labeled places, saved places, photos)
2. Group locations by region using geocoding
3. Correlate photos with regions and places
4. Build comprehensive visit timeline
5. Generate human-readable reports

### Key Features
- 10-mile radius for regional grouping
- Geocoding cache to minimize API calls
- Multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis
- Chronological visit tracking
- Regional visit patterns and insights

## Estimated Total Effort

Total estimated hours: 33 hours

### By Priority:
- High Priority: 12 hours
- Medium Priority: 15 hours  
- Low Priority: 6 hours

## Implementation Order

Recommended implementation sequence considering dependencies:

1. Task 008 - Geocoding cache (infrastructure)
2. Task 001 - Extract labeled places (foundation)
3. Task 002 - Extract saved places (builds on 001)
4. Task 003 - Extract photo data (parallel)
5. Task 004 - Correlate photos (needs 001-003)
6. Task 005 - Extract reviews (needs 001-002)
7. Task 006 - Generate timeline (needs 004-005)
8. Task 009 - Main script (integration)
9. Task 007 - Summary report (needs all data)
10. Task 010 - Testing (final validation)

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:
- All Google Takeout Maps data is successfully extracted
- Photos are accurately matched to regions
- Visit timeline shows chronological travel history
- Regional summaries include all data sources
- Human-readable report provides actionable insights
- System handles large datasets efficiently
- All operations are non-destructive (read-only)
